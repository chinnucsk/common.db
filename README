If you want to use filemaker or any other odbc based backend you need a patched
version of odbc. The patch implements GET_TABLES function as well as provides
ability to specify location of odbc port driver via Options passed to application.
In order to get patched version of odbc you can use following commands. 

sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
git clone git@github.com:khia/otp.git
cd otp
./otp_build autoconf
export ERL_TOP=`pwd`
./configure  --with-odbc
cd lib/odbc/
./configure
export TARGET=i686-pc-linux-gnu # put you TARGET here
make
